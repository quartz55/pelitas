          A dozen meters from the sea-facing south, WHITE is the result of the
          passion that João and Catarina Reis share for the art of creating
          unique places in unique environments. The result is to provide an
          exclusive experience to those who visit us, where time has another
          rhythm that brings us the stillness of the Azorean nature. It was
          during a walk that João and Catarina Reis identified the ruins of an
          old summer house, where the immensity of the views and the magic of
          the place made them dream.
